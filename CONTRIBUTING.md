# How To Contibute

As part of the focus on _collaboration and adaptability around determining standards_, the Technology Radar is open to contributions by all.
 
## Release Cadence

Because our Radar is a tool to guide development and design decisions, it should be as up-to-date as it can be at any time that someone looks to it for guidance.  For this reason, there is no release cadence.  Each PR will go through an approval process independent of other PRs.

## Change Process

Before making any changes, please review the README.md for structure and formatting information.

At any point in time, you can:
 - Get ad hoc feedback
   - Ask a question in the #technology-radar slack channel
 - Create a PR
   - Reach out to peers for feedback and opinions before making change
   - Open a PR with changes you wish to see
   - Include a description of the changes, and reasoning to support the change
   - MUST: Include a Principal Engineer as approver.  The Principal will guide the PR through the approval process.
   
Approval Process:
 - The Principal designated as the approver will bring the PR to the #technology-radar channel 
 - The PR is open for public discourse
 - Before a decision can be made, all Engineering Managers and Principal Engineers must be made aware of the pending changes  
 - If the plurality agrees with the change, the PR will be approved and merged into master branch

## Versioning Strategy

The Technology Radar is a living document and does not require version numbering.  The state of the Radar can, at any time, be considered the product of all changes from the beginning of time up to the date/time of the latest master merge.
